# Tweens
A very basic tween libaray for LOVE2D, made just for practice.
(I dont recommend using this as other very nice libraries are out there)

## Features
Has many different easing funtions and tweens with that function over the provided duration.

## Credits
- Class.lua taken from [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump) for OOP in lua
- Various easing functions can be found [here](https://easings.net/)
